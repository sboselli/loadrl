 innoextract - A tool to unpack installers created by Inno Setup
=================================================================

Inno Setup (http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) is a tool to create
installers for Microsoft Windows applications. innoextract allows to extract
such installers under non-Windows systems without running the actual installer
using wine. innoextract currently supports installers created by Inno Setup
1.2.10 to 5.6.0.

In addition to standard Inno Setup installers, innoextract also supports
some modified Inno Setup variants including Martijn Laan's My Inno Setup
Extensions 3.0.6.1 as well as GOG.com's Inno Setup-based game installers.

innoextract is available under the ZLIB license - see the LICENSE file.

See the website for Linux packages
(http://constexpr.org/innoextract/#packages).

 Run
=====

To extract a setup file to the current directory run:

    innoextract <file>

A list of available options can be retrieved using

    innoextract --help

Documentation is also available as a man page:

    see doc/innoextract.txt


 Limitations
=============

 - There is no support for extracting individual components and limited
   support for filtering by name.

 - Included scripts and checks are not executed.

 - The mapping from Inno Setup variables like the application directory to
   subdirectories is hard-coded.

 - Names for data slice/disk files in multi-file installers must follow the
   standard naming scheme.

A perhaps more complete, but Windows-only, tool to extract Inno Setup files
is innounp (http://innounp.sourceforge.net/).

Extracting Windows installer executables created by programs other than Inno
Setup is out of the scope of this project. Some of these can be unpacked by
the following programs:

 - cabextract: http://www.cabextract.org.uk/

 - unshield: https://github.com/twogood/unshield
