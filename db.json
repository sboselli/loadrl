    "desc": "Alphaman is a classic post-apocalyptic roguelike.\n\nThe player takes on the role of a genetically impure human undertaking a very important mission. Further information is to be found on a tape recording. This recording will self-destruct after transmitting the message. Each time a game is started two mutations are randomly selected and assigned to the player character. One physical mutation and one mental mutation, both chosen from a quite large set.\n\nPhysical mutations are typically combat oriented. Tentacles, quills, poison claws and tough exoskeleton all are available. Most mutations are limited by a cooldown system. After activating an effect you need to wait a bit until you can use it again. Mental changes include cryogenics, military genius, scientific genius, and hypnosis. Using different combinations of mutations each playthrough adds a unique element of enjoyment and enhances the game's replayability.\n\nThere are a lot of humorous elements in the game. For example toilet paper is very effective against dung beetles.\n\nAlphaman feature wide array of cool technological devices, usually unidentified when found. Unlike most roguelikes identification is not accomplished by use or through a 'foo of identify'. The player has to use a 'f'igure out command which results in the character trying to reveal possible ways to use it. However, if you happen to fail badly the item will break! The machines range from tiny pencil sharpeners to large, heavy and cumbersome dialysis machines.\n\nBerries take the place of potions in the world of Alphaman. Each berry subspecimen has a random name. The potency of a berry is measured by its ripeness which in turn is determined by its color. Riper berries have stronger effects while less ripe ones almost no effect. It is important to discover bad berries by eating them when unripe but use beneficial ones when they are ripest. This leads to many identification strategies.\n\nAlphaman's overworld is randomly generated anew for each game. The overworld is free to roam and explore, although the locations of castles (places where quests crucial to game victory can be completed) are known. Randomly placed ruined buildings can also be found while traveling. They are often worth exploring for the many useful treasures which may be hidden within.\n\nIn Alphaman the player needs to eat and sleep. The use of caffeine may delay the sleep timer somewhat.\n\nThe total time to complete the game is limited just like in Larn and Fallout 1. If you fail to achieve victory before the archenemy manages to accomplish his plan it is the same as if you had died. There are three difficulty levels available if winning seems too difficult. These modes are available at the start of the game.\n\nAlphaman also features the ability to save the game and continuing to play.",

Each day you may be called up for combat, and during ca combat day you choose how to proceed across a procedurally-generated terrain map, leading your battlegroup into combat. Battle encounters take place on a hex map, where you must order your crew to deal with enemy forces ranging from infantry squads to Tiger tanks. As you progress and gain Victory Points, your crew gains experience, levels, and skill points, which can be used to purpose skills and improve their effectiveness.\n\nThe M4 Sherman tank was outgunned and outnumbered by enemy forces upon arrival in Normandy, and in ArmCom the situation is the same. You cannot roll forward, guns blazing, and expect to survive even a single day of combat. Instead you must learn to use the same tactics as historical tank crews: using cover, smoke, and mobility to survive and help destroy enemy forces that you encounter.\n\nTwo campaigns are available: 'Patton's Best' where you fight as part of the American 4th Armoured Division, and 'Canada's Best', where you command a tank in the Canadian 4th Armoured Division.",

    "desc": "Last week I completed DataQueen, my 4th successful 7DRL. It’s a hex-based roguelike with a number of unique mechanics that makes it very tight and tactical without ever feeling too overwhelming.\n\nThe big concept I wanted to try in the game was from the board game Hive, where you only die if you get surrounded. This seemed like a cool idea to port to roguelikes! So enemies can’t attack you directly, and movement is very important.\n\nAt the same time you have a wheel of special abilities called the 'hex wheel'. For each hex direction you move in you have a special attack that hits in that direction. You can gain new hexes and place them on the wheel as the game progresses. This gives a range of tactical options all tied to just the movement keys. Every turn the wheel spins, meaning you have to plan moves and positioning if you want to chain attacks together. The abilities have all been designed to combine in interesting ways, encouraging the player to make multi-turn attacks.\n\nMovement itself is made more interesting by giving you free movement on green grids. This lets you reposition yourself for different attack directions very easily. Moving onto blue grids converts them to to green, but enemies will do the opposite, quickly eating up your useful tactical space. This cuts across all the mechanics in the game and adds a lot of tactical depth. To progress you need to connect pink grids up with green grids, so the war with enemies is mostly one of terrain (and not dying).\n\nThe base enemies all have unique abilities which can challenge the player. Most enemies die in one hit, but they can be a huge problem in mass numbers. Each level there is a boss, and each of these requires special tactics to overcome. It makes for a challenging game that hopefully never feels unfair.",

Objectives include disabling security devices, crashing systems, retrieval and/or deletion of data, creation of backdoors and many more. For completing a contract, the player is awarded with reputation and money. Any valuable files downloaded while in cyberspace are sold and also added to credits. On the other hand, reputation may suffer if many missions are failed. In cyberspace, the player may hack into databases, fight various ICE (Intrusion Countermeasure programs), collect information, and several more activities. Sometimes source code is found and upon downloading can prove to be a valuable tool for the hacker to use. Gained money may be used to upgrade hardware, pay for treatment, new software and rental payment.\n\nThe game is divided into two contexts: inside the Matrix, when the player is invading systems, jacked to his cyberdeck; and in the real world, where you manage the character's life: from choosing jobs (or waiting for new ones) to developing new software, hardware, resting, shopping and paying the rent.",

To beat the dungeon, you'll need to learn when it is wise to dash to flee, when you should try a special attack to try slithing a monster's throat in one turn, how to lure monsters into traps, etc. Then, only the bravest mercenaries will succeed in winning the game… Good luck!\n\nDungeon Mercenary is a dungeon crawler game where levels (and items, and monsters, etc.) are randomly generated. This means that you never get to play the same game twice! Famous roguelikes include Blizzard's Diablo sequel, Torchlight, etc. Dungeon Mercenary is a much more humble game than those super productions. Like classic roguelikes, it is in ASCII art. This means there are no graphics: a wall is displayed '#', the player is displayed '@', a goblin is displayed 'g', etc. Don't run away! ASCII-roguelikes make your imagination do the job. Once you're accustomed (and believe me, it's quick!), you'll enjoy it as much as a graphical game; because hey we did not stop reading books when movies were invented!",

Running a new pre-alpha build on an existing game may crash or corrupt your save file. Play at your own risk. :-P\n\nBasic instructions\n\nBecause the game is still pre-alpha, it does not come with in-game help, so to get you started, here are some basic keyboard controls (mouse support is planned but currently completely unimplemented):\n\ni, j, k, l: Movement keys. I know, I know, why not vi keys, right? And why no diagonal movement? Well, I did warn that this is pre-alpha...\n\nd: Drink something. Either water you sucked into your trunk, or something on the ground.\n\ne: Eat something. Either something you're already holding, or something on the ground.\n\n,: Pick up something.\n\nt (+ direction key): Apply your tusks to something. Currently, peels tree bark or gores an NPC.\n\n(space): Pass your turn. Currently unimportant, but will become part of tactical movement.\n\n/: Enter examine mode. In this mode, movement keys do not move your character, but only the on-map cursor. Position your cursor over a tile you'd like to examine, and the 'you see' panel will show you what's currently on that tile. Press 'q' to leave examine mode and return to normal gameplay mode.\n\nq: Save current game and quit. The game will automatically continue the next time you start the program. Warning: always exit the game with 'q' if you want to keep your current character; if the game terminates for any other reason, you will permanently lose your character. Welcome to permadeath. :-D\n\nQ: Delete current game and quit. Warning: once deleted, it is impossible to get your character back.\n\nHOW TO WIN (spoiler!)\n\nBelieve it or not, even in its pre-alpha state it's possible to win this game. Basically, you're expected to show up within a certain radius of the terminal point where (supposedly) the rest of your herd is waiting. But the question is, how to get there. Here are some tips:\n\n+ Eat and drink as much as you can. It's a vast desert landscape, and you will die of hunger or thirst otherwise.\n\nIn the midst of the desert landscape there are little islands of fertile land. Try to move from island to island as you search for your destination, instead of striking out into no-man's land (or no-elephants' land!), so that you can always keep hydrated and your huge elephant tummy filled.\n\n(Spoiler) These islands basically form a linear path of 'stepping stones' to your final destination (note: for this version only!). What you want to do is to make little excursions from your current island in each direction to see if you can spot the next island. If not, return and fill up on food/water and try again in another direction. Otherwise, move on to the next island and repeat.\n\nNote that because this is pre-alpha, your herd members are pretty stupid, and will likely be dead from starvation or hunger, or killed by lions, by the time you reach them. This is usual, albeit not intentional, and will be fixed eventually!",

Explore about 50 different worlds, each with its own unique treasures, enemies, and terrain obstacles. Your quest is to find the legendary treasure, the Orbs of Yendor. Collect one of them to win! Or just ignore your quest and collect smaller treasures.\n\nThe twist is the unique, unusual geometry of the world: it is one of just few games which takes place on the hyperbolic plane. Witness a grid composed of hexagons and heptagons, straight lines which seem to be parallel, but then they diverge and never cross, triangles whose angles add up to less than 180 degrees, how extremely unlikely is it to reach the same place twice, and how the world seems to be rotated when you do return. All this matters for the gameplay. The game is inspired by the roguelike genre (although in a very minimalist way), works of M. C. Escher, and by puzzle games such as Deadly Rooms of Death.",

The dungeon has branch offices of the town's bank. Larn is also time-limited, achieving the main goal too late counts as losing the game. The player is trying to find an item which can cure his ailing daughter, and for which there is a Nethack-like extended quest. If the time limit is reached, the daughter dies.\n\nA few features which are unique to Larn and make it worth playing:\nIdentification is always successful. The scroll/potion type will always be known to the player regardless whether the player received any clue about the usage of the particular item.\nThe Scroll of gem perfection enhances the value of carried gems.\nIf a character manages to win Larn, his successor will have to pay taxes, which depend on the amount of gold brought to the surface.\nGold pieces stored in the bank earn interest over time.\nSpells are cast by typing a 3-letter mnemonic. For example, magic missile is MLE.\nThe level generation is exceptionally varied: You can find mazes, rows of rooms with doors, round chambers, and open spaces with or without pillars, but still generated at random as in any other roguelike.\nMany other conventional Roguelike features are also given a unique spin (many conventions in the genre were less set in stone), and it can be an interesting change of pace.",

So a rewrite seemed to be the best idea - and that is what I did.\n\nAs I never really played Larn, NLarn might be quite different to Larn in certain areas, but at least I tried to follow the original. Some aspects of Larn’s game-play (which I only experienced by reading the code) seemed a bit weird and didn’t suit my taste, so I changed them intentionally. Other changes are caused by the unreadability of Larn’s code.\n\nAs today’s computers are a bit more advanced compared to those in the eighties, I could do a completely different approach to how things are handled under the cover.\n\nVery noticeable differences to the original so far include:\n\n+ advanced user interface\n+ extremely different item handling\n+ extended monster AI\n+ a real town\n+ \"graphical\" effects\n+ colour",

Sometimes you may want to drop your parts, but you can only do this by 'purging' them, which destroys half of what you have while scattering the rest across the ground. Then you're free to rebuild by moving towards (hopefully) the remaining or other nearby parts that you want to attract. The Purge mechanic requires 100 turns to charge before it can be used again, however, so be careful in choosing when to carry it out.\n\nPOLYBOT-7 is available with both a tileset and in glorious ASCII form, which you can toggle at the press of a button (F3!). It also supports movement via mouse, numpad, arrows, and vi-keys out of the box, along with a ton of other customization options.\n\nSee the manual included with the game for more info!

For more information and development details , see the release announcement on the dev blog, as well as the in-depth four-part postmortem.\n\nIf you enjoy POLYBOT-7's style but want more, check out my magnum opus that I've been working on full-time for over five years now: Cogmind (also on Steam). It features a much bigger world to explore, and far more polish and content. (You also have a lot more control over your build; while similar in style and theme, POLYBOT-7 is a rather different experience.)",

The game is currently in a development, but is in a playable state.\n\nFeatures:\n\n+ Buy cheaply, sell expensive: find best trade routes between sky bases.\n\n+ Do randomly generated missions to gain money and reputation at sky bases.\n+ Manage your ship's crew: give them orders, hire new ones or dismiss old members.\n\n+ Manage your ship: upgrade installed modules, install new ones, or repair damaged ones.\n\n+ Craft items: from tools through repair materials to food.\n\nFight with enemy ships in tactical combat.",

    "desc": "From Daniel:\n\nThis page is dedicated to Telengard, an ancient computer game which I wrote in 1982. This game was then sold by Avalon Hill, and was available for the Commodore Pet, the Apple, the TRS-80, the Atari 400/800, the Commodore C64 and eventually the IBM-PCjr and the IBM-PC. It is a dungeon crawl, creating an adventurer whom wanders through the depths of the Telengard Dungeon and was itself an evolution of an older program I wrote, DND, which ran on the PDP-11 under RSTS/E and on the DECSystem-20 under TOPS-20.\n\nDND was written on the DECSystem-10 at BOCES Spencerport (New York) where I worked in the summer of 1976 and 1977. It was written in BASIC under the TOPS-10 operating system.\n\nI went to collage at Purdue University and quickly ported DND to the RSTS/E system there in 1977 through 1979. It was very popular with my fellow students there and was, sad to say, the cause of more than one student dropping out of school. Also it made me very unpopular with the computing staff at Purdue. I had one very interesting side trip when I was asked to come out to Maynard, MA to the Mill at Digital Equipment Corporation to port DND to their DECSystem-20. The engineers there were very big fans of the game.\n\nIn 1978, Commodore marketed the first PET 2001. I ponied up the $1200 to get this and I was freed from dependence on the university's machines. I rewrote DND in BASIC, calling it TELENGARD and fitting its early versions into 8K of memory. Luckily memory expansion occurred quickly, and the final version of this ran barely inside a luxurious 32K of memory.\n\nGaining the notice of the people at the Avalon Hill Gaming company, TELENGARD was among their first round of computer game releases. Alas, Avalon Hill is no longer with us. Ports to the Apple and the TRS-80 happened very quickly, after all Microsoft 8K BASIC was very similar in all these machines, just some details about the display and sound had to be recoded. The Atari 400/800 was more challenging, its internal handling of string variables was completely different.",

Set approximately around the Scientific Revolution, the player is tasked with discovering a conspiracy via identifying procedurally-generated clues hidden throughout the world’s cultures, religions and societies; the game features extensive procedural generation of everything from tombs and religious altars to (in the future) paintings and sculptures, any or all of which may contain the clues required in a given playthrough.",

Your goal is to delve deep into a dungeon, find a portal to a mythical place called the Zorbus where a mere mortal can ascend to demigodhood.\n\nBeing a roguelike game, Zorbus creates the dungeon randomly so that every played game is slightly different. The game uses permadeath meaning that when a character dies, it really is permanent and the player must begin a new game. You can save the game but the save file is deleted when loaded.\n\nThematically Zorbus draws influence from the late 70s and early 80s tabletop D&D campaigns, adventures and lore.\n\nThe goal is to create a tight dungeon crawling experience where the dungeon feels alive, eventful and rich in content. Something more than just boring empty rooms and corridors! Diversely shaped levels with themed content (throne rooms, prisons, lots of hidden treasure caches etc.) with good connectivity between the areas.\n\nImportant part of the living dungeon are the creatures. Creatures act intelligently, might fight each other, flee when threatened and try to gather their friends to overcome a threat. Most creatures can use items and also pick them up from the dungeon floor. Creatures are not silent either but comment on things with speech bubbles.\n\nThe dungeon has dynamic lighting. There are light sources as dungeon furniture and in the hands of creatures and these both can be lit and unlit. Some creatures have darkvision. Creatures react to light and sound.\n\nYou don't have to go to the fight alone but can recruit other creatures along the way.\n\nThe rule system for the game is slightly influenced by the d20 system used in the 3rd edition of Dungeons & Dragons. Zorbus has experience levels but no character classes (race is selected). On each level up, you point buy skills and talents (mostly combat maneuvers and spells).\n\nZorbus does not have item identification or a hunger mechanic.",
