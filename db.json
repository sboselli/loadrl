Further information is to be found on a tape recording. This recording will self-destruct after transmitting the message. Each time a game is started two mutations are randomly selected and assigned to the player character. One physical mutation and one mental mutation, both chosen from a quite large set.\n\nPhysical mutations are typically combat oriented. Tentacles, quills, poison claws and tough exoskeleton all are available. Most mutations are limited by a cooldown system. After activating an effect you need to wait a bit until you can use it again. Mental changes include cryogenics, military genius, scientific genius, and hypnosis. Using different combinations of mutations each playthrough adds a unique element of enjoyment and enhances the game's replayability.\n\nThere are a lot of humorous elements in the game. For example toilet paper is very effective against dung beetles.\n\nAlphaman feature wide array of cool technological devices, usually unidentified when found. Unlike most roguelikes identification is not accomplished by use or through a 'foo of identify'. The player has to use a 'f'igure out command which results in the character trying to reveal possible ways to use it. However, if you happen to fail badly the item will break! The machines range from tiny pencil sharpeners to large, heavy and cumbersome dialysis machines.\n\nBerries take the place of potions in the world of Alphaman. Each berry subspecimen has a random name. The potency of a berry is measured by its ripeness which in turn is determined by its color. Riper berries have stronger effects while less ripe ones almost no effect. It is important to discover bad berries by eating them when unripe but use beneficial ones when they are ripest. This leads to many identification strategies.\n\nAlphaman's overworld is randomly generated anew for each game. The overworld is free to roam and explore, although the locations of castles (places where quests crucial to game victory can be completed) are known. Randomly placed ruined buildings can also be found while traveling. They are often worth exploring for the many useful treasures which may be hidden within.\n\nIn Alphaman the player needs to eat and sleep. The use of caffeine may delay the sleep timer somewhat.\n\nThe total time to complete the game is limited just like in Larn and Fallout 1. If you fail to achieve victory before the archenemy manages to accomplish his plan it is the same as if you had died. There are three difficulty levels available if winning seems too difficult. These modes are available at the start of the game.\n\nAlphaman also features the ability to save the game and continuing to play.",

It is no longer in active development, but the original source code and Windows binaries are still available for download.\n\nIn Armoured Commander (ArmCom) your goal is to survive the campaign, which runs from 1944 to 1945, and accumulate as many Victory Points as you can during that time. Each day you may be called up for combat, and during ca combat day you choose how to proceed across a procedurally-generated terrain map, leading your battlegroup into combat. Battle encounters take place on a hex map, where you must order your crew to deal with enemy forces ranging from infantry squads to Tiger tanks. As you progress and gain Victory Points, your crew gains experience, levels, and skill points, which can be used to purpose skills and improve their effectiveness.\n\nThe M4 Sherman tank was outgunned and outnumbered by enemy forces upon arrival in Normandy, and in ArmCom the situation is the same. You cannot roll forward, guns blazing, and expect to survive even a single day of combat. Instead you must learn to use the same tactics as historical tank crews: using cover, smoke, and mobility to survive and help destroy enemy forces that you encounter.\n\nTwo campaigns are available: 'Patton's Best' where you fight as part of the American 4th Armoured Division, and 'Canada's Best', where you command a tank in the Canadian 4th Armoured Division.",

    "desc": "Last week I completed DataQueen, my 4th successful 7DRL. It’s a hex-based roguelike with a number of unique mechanics that makes it very tight and tactical without ever feeling too overwhelming.\n\nThe big concept I wanted to try in the game was from the board game Hive, where you only die if you get surrounded. This seemed like a cool idea to port to roguelikes! So enemies can’t attack you directly, and movement is very important.\n\nAt the same time you have a wheel of special abilities called the 'hex wheel'. For each hex direction you move in you have a special attack that hits in that direction. You can gain new hexes and place them on the wheel as the game progresses. This gives a range of tactical options all tied to just the movement keys. Every turn the wheel spins, meaning you have to plan moves and positioning if you want to chain attacks together. The abilities have all been designed to combine in interesting ways, encouraging the player to make multi-turn attacks.\n\nMovement itself is made more interesting by giving you free movement on green grids. This lets you reposition yourself for different attack directions very easily. Moving onto blue grids converts them to to green, but enemies will do the opposite, quickly eating up your useful tactical space. This cuts across all the mechanics in the game and adds a lot of tactical depth. To progress you need to connect pink grids up with green grids, so the war with enemies is mostly one of terrain (and not dying).\n\nThe base enemies all have unique abilities which can challenge the player. Most enemies die in one hit, but they can be a huge problem in mass numbers. Each level there is a boss, and each of these requires special tactics to overcome. It makes for a challenging game that hopefully never feels unfair.",

In this tile-based cyberpunk RL, you are one of the deckers, running in cyberspace to earn skill and money to upgrade your equipment.\n\nThe player takes on the role of a hacker who wants to earn reputation and money. To achieve this, a decker signs contracts and enters computers systems to fulfill the current mission. Objectives include disabling security devices, crashing systems, retrieval and/or deletion of data, creation of backdoors and many more. For completing a contract, the player is awarded with reputation and money. Any valuable files downloaded while in cyberspace are sold and also added to credits. On the other hand, reputation may suffer if many missions are failed. In cyberspace, the player may hack into databases, fight various ICE (Intrusion Countermeasure programs), collect information, and several more activities. Sometimes source code is found and upon downloading can prove to be a valuable tool for the hacker to use. Gained money may be used to upgrade hardware, pay for treatment, new software and rental payment.\n\nThe game is divided into two contexts: inside the Matrix, when the player is invading systems, jacked to his cyberdeck; and in the real world, where you manage the character's life: from choosing jobs (or waiting for new ones) to developing new software, hardware, resting, shopping and paying the rent.",

Under this reverse role scenario the player is represented by a black square and the enemies, adventurers, are represented by '@' symbols. Light emitted from adventurers instantly kills the grue, whilst getting adventurers to walk into the grue instantly kills them. The light emitted by adventurers can also be disabled using a shadow spell, allowing the grue to attack and eat them directly. The player starts on the bottom of a cavern system 20 levels deep, and the game is completed by reaching the surface.\n\nThe game is intended to provide simple, fast gameplay with frequent deaths to make it addictive and fun. Unlike many others roguelikes there are no hit points and few stats - light will instantly kill the grue, and the grue can instantly kill adventurers in the right circumstances. There are technically no impossible scenarios, but as the game progresses the caverns become tighter and the enemies more frequent, leading to extremely difficult and tense situations. Levels are non-permanent and can be regenerated to make the game easier. Upon winning the game the player is presented with a number of achievements representing their gameplay habits.",

NLarn tries to maintain the atmosphere and story of the original game while improving the gameplay by using state-of-the-art roguelike technology and a simplified user interface.\n\nAbout:\n\nNLarn is a roguelike game and as such a remake of the classic game Larn.\n\nMy intention when starting this project was to get a copy of Larn that one could actually play: I just couldn’t stand the user interface of the original. To improve it, I peeked into the original code, which revealed to be unmaintainable. So a rewrite seemed to be the best idea - and that is what I did.\n\nAs I never really played Larn, NLarn might be quite different to Larn in certain areas, but at least I tried to follow the original. Some aspects of Larn’s game-play (which I only experienced by reading the code) seemed a bit weird and didn’t suit my taste, so I changed them intentionally. Other changes are caused by the unreadability of Larn’s code.\n\nAs today’s computers are a bit more advanced compared to those in the eighties, I could do a completely different approach to how things are handled under the cover.\n\nVery noticeable differences to the original so far include:\n\n+ advanced user interface\n+ extremely different item handling\n+ extended monster AI\n+ a real town\n+ \"graphical\" effects\n+ colour",

The main dungeon is longer in Slash'EM Extended than in SLASH'EM, with the upper Dungeons of Doom being 50 levels in length followed by 50 levels of Gehennom, meaning that Moloch's Sanctum is on dungeon level 100. After claiming the Amulet of Yendor, the player also needs to complete a 100-level bonus dungeon before the actual ascension run begins, greatly increasing the length of the game.

This game was then sold by Avalon Hill, and was available for the Commodore Pet, the Apple, the TRS-80, the Atari 400/800, the Commodore C64 and eventually the IBM-PCjr and the IBM-PC. It is a dungeon crawl, creating an adventurer whom wanders through the depths of the Telengard Dungeon and was itself an evolution of an older program I wrote, DND, which ran on the PDP-11 under RSTS/E and on the DECSystem-20 under TOPS-20.\n\nDND was written on the DECSystem-10 at BOCES Spencerport (New York) where I worked in the summer of 1976 and 1977. It was written in BASIC under the TOPS-10 operating system.\n\nI went to collage at Purdue University and quickly ported DND to the RSTS/E system there in 1977 through 1979. It was very popular with my fellow students there and was, sad to say, the cause of more than one student dropping out of school. Also it made me very unpopular with the computing staff at Purdue. I had one very interesting side trip when I was asked to come out to Maynard, MA to the Mill at Digital Equipment Corporation to port DND to their DECSystem-20. The engineers there were very big fans of the game.\n\nIn 1978, Commodore marketed the first PET 2001. I ponied up the $1200 to get this and I was freed from dependence on the university's machines. I rewrote DND in BASIC, calling it TELENGARD and fitting its early versions into 8K of memory. Luckily memory expansion occurred quickly, and the final version of this ran barely inside a luxurious 32K of memory.\n\nGaining the notice of the people at the Avalon Hill Gaming company, TELENGARD was among their first round of computer game releases. Alas, Avalon Hill is no longer with us. Ports to the Apple and the TRS-80 happened very quickly, after all Microsoft 8K BASIC was very similar in all these machines, just some details about the display and sound had to be recoded. The Atari 400/800 was more challenging, its internal handling of string variables was completely different.",

In order to guide the player, procedural message logs are created and dropped along the player's route to guide them to the next objective.\n\nInspiration-wise, I wanted to take the tight RL shooting mechanics from games like DoomRL and combine with the adventure-style mission of games like System Shock.

Your goal is to delve deep into a dungeon, find a portal to a mythical place called the Zorbus where a mere mortal can ascend to demigodhood.\n\nBeing a roguelike game, Zorbus creates the dungeon randomly so that every played game is slightly different. The game uses permadeath meaning that when a character dies, it really is permanent and the player must begin a new game. You can save the game but the save file is deleted when loaded.\n\nThematically Zorbus draws influence from the late 70s and early 80s tabletop D&D campaigns, adventures and lore.\n\nThe goal is to create a tight dungeon crawling experience where the dungeon feels alive, eventful and rich in content. Something more than just boring empty rooms and corridors! Diversely shaped levels with themed content (throne rooms, prisons, lots of hidden treasure caches etc.) with good connectivity between the areas.\n\nImportant part of the living dungeon are the creatures. Creatures act intelligently, might fight each other, flee when threatened and try to gather their friends to overcome a threat. Most creatures can use items and also pick them up from the dungeon floor. Creatures are not silent either but comment on things with speech bubbles.\n\nThe dungeon has dynamic lighting. There are light sources as dungeon furniture and in the hands of creatures and these both can be lit and unlit. Some creatures have darkvision. Creatures react to light and sound.\n\nYou don't have to go to the fight alone but can recruit other creatures along the way.\n\nThe rule system for the game is slightly influenced by the d20 system used in the 3rd edition of Dungeons & Dragons. Zorbus has experience levels but no character classes (race is selected). On each level up, you point buy skills and talents (mostly combat maneuvers and spells).\n\nZorbus does not have item identification or a hunger mechanic.",
